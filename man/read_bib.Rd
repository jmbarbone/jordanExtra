\description{
Read a bib file into a data.frame
}
\details{
Inspired and partially credited to [bib2df::bib2df()] although this has no
  dependencies outside of base functions and much quicker.  This speed seems
  to come from removing `stringr` functions and simplifying a few *apply
  functions.
This will also include as many categories as possible from the entry.

\examples{
file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmbarbone/bib-references/master/references.bib"
bibdf <- read_bib(file, max_lines = 51L)

\dontrun{
if (requireNamespace("tibble")) tibble::as_tibble(bibdf) else head(bibdf)

if (requireNamespace("bib2df") & requireNamespace("microbenchmark")) {
  file1 <- system.file("extdata", "bib2df_testfile_3.bib", package = "bib2df")

  # Doesn't include the 'tidying' up
  foo <- function(file) {
    bib <- bib2df:::bib2df_read(file)
    bib2df:::bib2df_gather(bib)
  }

  microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    read_bib(file1),
    bib2df::bib2df(file1),
    foo(file1)
  )
